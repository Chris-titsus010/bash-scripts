# AFK Lock

Leave your computer open and unattended securely.  
While this program is running, you can let your automation tasks running with the screen still on.

Typing letters and numbers are allowed but the rest of the keyboard, the touchpad and the mouse are off-limit until a password is typed to stop the program.
Attemps to workaround the secruity will trigger an intruder alert and deepen the security, screen will be off until password is typed.
