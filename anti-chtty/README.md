# Anti-chtty

Script to counter CTRL+ALT+F4 prank by switching back tty (GUI)

Could prompt for security activation and run lock.sh after first switch if under chtty (Change of Tty) attack, if chtty was intentional, could turn off anti-chtty protection for a certain amount of time.


CAUTION: Playing around with this nearly broke the computer
