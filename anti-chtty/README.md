:warning: **Warning** : Playing around with this nearly broke the computer :exclamation:

### Improvements:
 - Could prompt for security activation and run lock.sh after first switch if under chtty (Change of Tty) attack, if chtty was intentional, could turn off anti-chtty protection for a certain amount of time.
