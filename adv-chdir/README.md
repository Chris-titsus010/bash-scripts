### Improvements:
 - checks for permission in case needed so user gets prompted with sudo
 - letting user choose directory if multiple results found
 - flag that takes the most relevant result without letting the user choose if multiple results
 - flag that searches from home
 - flag that searches from root
 - flag that takes starting point directory (default current location)
 - flag that takes depth of target directory
 - flag that takes the name of one or multiple directories located between starting point and target (if multiple, must be in order)
 - flag that takes a timeout value
 - verbose flag that displays all directories it searches for target
